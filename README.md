# INSPIRATION üí°

-   In recent years, there have been many protests by doctors all over the country. One of the most important reasons behind these protests is unemployment and lower wages. To help address this problem, we are introducing DocConnect, a web app that provides self-employment opportunities to doctors or serves as a source of additional income.
-   Doctors are some of the most important people in our society since they have the capability to save lives. We believe that by supporting them and providing them with more opportunities to work, we can help them continue to make a positive impact on people‚Äôs lives.

# HOW IT FUNCTIONS ‚öôÔ∏è

-   When a person logs into our website, they are presented with two options: one for being a patient and the other for being a doctor. If the person selects ‚Äúpatient,‚Äù our website will use the location of their computer to filter out nearby doctors and hospitals. It will also show price ranges and comments on the conditions of the hospital. After the patient chooses their doctor, they can teleconsult and chat with them.
-   If the person selects ‚Äúdoctor,‚Äù they are required to provide proper proof such as an MBBS and MD/MS degree by the Medical Council of India, a license of being a Registered Medical Practitioner, and proper experience in the field. If the doctor has a patient they need to treat, they can ask the patient to use our web app to choose the doctor who can then choose and book the hospital accordingly.
-   All the hospitals and nurseries, that are newly started can also contact us to link it to our website, to attract patients, hire doctors and promote these hospitals.

# MAJOR IMPACT ‚ÄºÔ∏è

-   Doctors save lives and thus helping doctors should be a country‚Äôs major objective but in the recent times there has been a lot of problems faced by them.
-   Our webapp has the potential to solve many of these problem. The doctors can use the facilities of other hospitals to treat their own patients and the hospitals can also hire the doctors thus providing doctors an extra source of income.
-   With the permission of the government we can also add public hospitals in our website. This would be beneficial for the rural and poor people since it would allow them to check the nearby hospitals and their conditions.
-   Doctors can also add their nurseries and clinics in our website and promote their place of work. This would provide them more patients and more income.

Therefore, we believe that if we are able to introduce this app on a large scale, we can improve the healthcare structure of our country and make it better for our patients as well as our doctors.

# CHALLENGES FACED üòì

-   Some of us had little experience with back-end development. However, we collaborated and helped each other get up to speed. As a result, we were able to get most features working.
-   Explaining the schematics of our project was challenging. We had to ensure that we explained all the functions of our webapp in a way that was proper and easy to understand.
-   Adding the location feature in our webapp to filter hospitals and doctors based on the user‚Äôs location was a big challenge.
-   Putting the self diagnosis feature in the website was also a problem. We overcame it by incorporating an AI based operation


# HOW IT WAS BENIFICIAL FOR US üßë‚Äçüíª


-   Through the hackathon, we learnt a lot of things like adding the location and AI based self diagnosis feature in our website. So, we were able to take our programming skill to the next level.
-   We were also able to enhance our imagination and use our creativity to solve some major problems of our country allowing us to use our programming skill to help other people.
-   One of the major things we learned from this was team work. Some of us had little experience with back-end development and making a proper webapp. So, we collaborated and helped each other to get all the features working and complete our web development project in time.

# WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT ‚ùì

- In coming future we look forward to expand our website considering if we get some funds and acknowledgment and would add features such as:
	- Ai diagnosis
	- Location search
	- Online pharmacy
